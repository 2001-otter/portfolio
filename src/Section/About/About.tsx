        <p>I'm a web developer with a 
          passion for front end development. I'm currently a first year student 
          at Technische Universit√§t Berlin pursuing a degree in information science. 
          I aspire toward a career that will allow me to channel my 
          creativity through crafting beautiful software and engaging experiences.
        <br/><br/>
          When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy playing guitar, jogging, and petting dogs.</p>
