            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
              With a passion and strong foundation in programming, I'm eager to
              contribute to the world through my code. That's why I'm trying to
              improve everyday by not just writing a code that works, but also a
              clean and undesrstandable code, that does well what it is intended
              to do and can be reused by others.
            </p>

              <i className="fas fa-tools fa-7x"></i>
            </Logo>
            <h3>Improve</h3>
            <p>
              "To be more and to do more"â€”a motto that I always adhere to. Life
              is a lifelong journey of improvement. I aspire to improve not only
              my technical skill, but also my soft skill as a programmer. I
              believe that to lead a meaningful life, it's essential to improve
              on every important aspect of life.

            <h3>Colaborate</h3>
            <p>
              Contrary to the popular image of a programmer: sitting alone in
              front of their computer in a dark room, I find that working in a
              team is a crucial part of developing a great project.
              Interchanging ideas, discussing the best solution to a problem,
              strengthening each other weaknesses; there are many advantages of
              working together in a team.
